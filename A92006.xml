            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IEhovah, the Almighty, the Alpha and Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga is knowne to be a God of mercy, as well as judgement: many times doth hee ſuffer his Children to be afflicted, and to groane unper the yoake of their enemies, as he did the Iſraelites, but at length ſent he a Moſes to deliver them, and to the terrour of the Egyptians broke their
<pb facs="tcp:111403:3"/>bonds in ſunder, drowning Pharoh and his Hoſt in the red Sea.</p>
            <p>David having offended in the matter of Vriah, God ſent the Prophet Nathan to bid him take his choiſe of three things, either of the Lword, Peſtilence, or Famint: now <hi>David</hi> very wiſely made this anſwer, that it was better to fall in the hauds of God than man; for with God there is mercy, with men none: wherefore God ſent the peſtilence, which deſtroyed many thouſands, but yet in the abundance of his tender mercy, at length hee bid the Angell to put up his ſword, ſaying it is enough.</p>
            <p>God in the time of Queen Mary ſuffered the proteſtants to be bloudily perſecuted: inſomuch as they might have cryed out, <hi>See and conſider, good God, how for thy ſake, wee are dilled all the day long;</hi> nay her owne ſiſter endured unpartiall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, but yet it pleaſed God of his infinite goodneſſe at length, to redeeme that myracle of piety, Queene <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> for ſo ſhe was happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afterwards brought from captivity; and the Goſpell had its free paſſage, by the death of Qu. Mary.</p>
            <p>Alſo in the Reigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did God ſuffer the Spanyards to mahe an invaſion: but yet out of his mercy did cut them off before they could bring to effect their intended bloudy Deſignes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:111403:3"/>
In the time of King <hi>Iames, God</hi> ſuffered the Papiſts to plot and invent the deſtruction of the Bloud royall, Noble and Common, but yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed their miſchievous purpoſe before the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall blow.</p>
            <p>Now in the Reigne of our religious King Charles, god hath ſuffered many to doe what miſchiefe they could poſſibly invent, but yet that which they were ſo long time hatching, the finall deſtruction of our ſoules I meane, god gave them not ſtrength to bring forth.</p>
            <p>How of late have the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over proteſtants, inſulted ſaid I, that word is not able to expreſſe their villany, and Tragicall Actions, as is too well already knowne amongſt us.</p>
            <p>But yet that we may know, that God hath not forgot his ſervants in <hi>Ireland:</hi> marke the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, marke the juſt Judgment, which God upon the 8. of December powred upon the heads of the rebellious papiſts.</p>
            <p>Vpon the 7. day of the ſame month, the rebels ſlew 22. ſhepheards belonging to the proteantſts and drove away their Cattell into the woods, where the reſt of the rebels kept their abode: there did they ſlay the greater part of the cattell, which they had violently the day before taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and cut downe very much of the wood to roſt the aforeſaid meate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:111403:4"/>
In the meane while it being the birth-day of that great rebell <hi>Don Makertodough,</hi> having barrels of wine and beere, they betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to drunkning very prophanely, as to the confuſion of all proteſtants, and the like.</p>
            <p>Vntill that they drunke themſelves to ſuch a paſſe, as that they were void of reaſon, and had loſt their ſenſes: inſomuch that each men quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel'ed with his companion, and quarrelling, fought, each running of his ſword into his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions breſt, each ſtarting, as being amazed, not knowing from whence their wounds came, ſome cryed out, we are undone, the Hereticks have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched us round, others curſed moſt bitterly, but no man being able to fight, would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare killing of his aext man: which grew to ſuch a bloudy skirmiſh, that there fell that day above three thouſand Rebels, ſlaine by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants hearing of it, adjoyning to thoſe parts, came and ceaſed upon the meat, which was ready dreſſed unto their hands.</p>
            <p>The living Cattell they drove away, and took that ſpoyle which was left by the Rebels, which there lay ſlaine.</p>
            <p>Thus hath God, thus doth God, and ſo will God, at all times revenge the cauſe of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb facs="tcp:111403:4"/>although not on the ſudden, yet when it ſhall ſeeme good in his owne ſight, and when we ſtand in moſt need of his ayd,</p>
